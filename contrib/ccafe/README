This directory includes a set of ports and a subdirectory
of event-related types (for framing-related (contextevent) events) that
may be of general use to any framework.

It also contains a static string lookup class Keys whose
implementation only exists in ccaffeine.

All this lives in the namespaces:
ccaffeine,
ccaffeine.ports,
ccaffeine.ce

Defining similar interfaces in the cca specification is welcome but unlikely.
