Updated to autoconf 2.62 and automake 1.10.
Fixed babel version checks for nightly tarballs of Babel
and corresponding Java client build details.
Bumped version to 0.8.6.

9/19/2006 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
0.8.1: Added contrib build support start. --disable-contrib to avoid
building contrib and to eliminate ccaffeine support.
Reduced server/ build to only stuff that's actually classes;
prior to this, server just duplicated client/cxx.
Added primitive pmake support in client build. need to
rationalize this with a config switch uniformly in spec, ccaffeine
that can then be passed to tools config line. 
setenv CCA_PMAKE "-j 2" for example.

8/31/2006 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
Added vpath build support. Now --srcdir allows to build in a separate
object tree. Babel off the 1.0.0 svn branch or later is needed to
build this; long names break bugs in the backends of 1.0.0 release.

4/3/2006 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
Moving to 0.8 with ucxx,dcxx build incompatibility

11/7/2005 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
Moving to version 0.7.10 which should be more python2.4 compliant
as the None enum value has gone away replaced with NoType.
Users of TypeMaps may care.

03/26/05 norris@mcs.anl.gov
* Small adjustments to Makefile.in, utils/Makefile_template.client.in
to remove the generation of an ior library since no _IOR.c files 
are generated for the current cca.sidl. On some architectures,
trying to create a library without any *.o's is a fatal error.

12/15/04 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
* Added babel-libtool usage.
Bumped patch level to 5 so that configure tools can check version to
insist on a spec with libtool support.

11/29/04 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
* removed gov_cca_CCAException_Impl and friends, as the spec is now all
interfaces. Added code generation script for ccaffeine commandline
to c++ builderservice.

10/16/04 norris@mcs.anl.gov
* Added automatic generation of clients for all Babel-supported languages
(still need to add most respective vars to MakeIncl and config.h)

8/10/04 norris@mcs.anl.gov
* Added variables for F90 settings to MakeIncl, obtained with babel-config
* Added src/genSCLCCA.sh to list of install files

7/31/04 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
* Patch for unified cca/scl xml generation.

# --------------------------
6/10/04 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
* Patch for darwin support in configure.

# --------------------------
5/06/04 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
* Updated to babel 0.9.2.
* Eliminated config support of prior incompatible babels.
* Added ServiceRegistry/ServiceProvider from recent vote.
* Added component .cca XML generation script, genSCLCCA.sh.
  This generator makes xml files:
  The .scl block required by babel.
  The component metadata block required by ccaffeine.
  Currently doesn't provide xml port data, pending more features requested from babel.
  Currently doesn't combine all xmls into a single file, as babel parser only
  supports a pure scl file.

# --------------------------
3/27/03 baallan@ca.sandia.gov
* The canonical build process is now "configure;make;make install".
  If no --prefix is specified, installation will be into the
  local build tree. "make install" is NOT optional.
  --with-babel=/somewhere is in most cases needed for configure.
* Added bin/cca-spec-babel-config-$sver-$bver, test-babel-config-$bver.
* cca.sidl is now generated at configure time, to cope with
  incompatible changes in the babel tool. 
* Future edits should be made to cca.sidl.in.
* CCA specification version number is defined in configure.in.
  Acsite.m4 must be updated to deal with later
  babel releases which are to be supported.
* Added installation logic to install multiple versions
  of the specifications and/or babel at once.
